Welcome to my journey in immersive content creation! Armed with a master's in computational intelligence and robotics engineering, I'm pushing real-time 3D computing boundaries with a Ph.D. at the Free University of Brussels. My impactful contributions in the MPEG community and the HoviTron project showcase the fusion of academia and industry.

In view synthesis, I've pioneered the Reference View Synthesizer (RVS), rivaling NeRF's quality with minimal GPU usage. Another milestone is the Reference Depth Estimation software (RDE), ensuring high-quality rendering. I've explored plenoptic cameras, especially the plenoptic 2.0, for dynamic perspectives.

Beyond, my ventures include a real-time point cloud viewer, Gaussian processes optimization, deep learning for view synthesis, robotic bench creation, and expertise in web technologies.
